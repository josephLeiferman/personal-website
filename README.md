## About
This is my personal website, built with Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS 4 — designed to showcase my professional background, side projects, and blog posts. The site uses MDX for content authoring, features a custom animated UI powered by [motion-primites](https://motion-primitives.com/docs), and includes theme support via next-themes.

Deployment is handled through Vercel, enabling seamless integration with GitHub for automated previews and production releases.

Key features include:

⚡ Fast, server-rendered React via Next.js App Router

📝 MDX support for writing interactive blog content

🎨 Tailwind Typography and custom animations

🌗 Dark/light theme toggle

📈 Built-in Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights
